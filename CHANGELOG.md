## 4.1.2
  - bugfix: improves trim_key and trim_value to trim any _sequence_ of matching characters from the beginning and ends of the corresponding keys and values; a previous implementation limitited trim to a single character from each end, which was surprising.
  - bugfix: fixes issue where we can fail to correctly break up a sequence that includes a partially-quoted value followed by another fully-quoted value by slightly reducing greediness of quoted-value captures.

## 4.0.0
  - breaking: trim and trimkey options are renamed to trim_value and trim_key

## 2.0.0

   instead of using Thread.raise on the plugins' threads. Ref: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/3895
